					Django is a high-level full stack open source web framework written in Python, that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django comes with lots of advance functionalities baked in which saves developers a lot of time. The simplicity Django offers lets developers focus more on writing the app instead of rewriting the same wheel. Since it's release in 2003 Django has proven to be the most productive framework for Python developers to know more about Django read: Django – Web Framework For Perfectionists.

					Though this is an optional step yet it is highly recommended to use virtual environments in your projects, to know why are virtual environments so important read: How To A Create Virtual Environment for Python.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a nutshell, virtual environment lets you have an isolated space on your computer for different Python projects, ensuring that each of your projects can have its own set of dependencies and modules that won’t disrupt any of your other projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's kick off by creating a virtual environment for our hello world project.
				</p>
				<h3>For Windows</h3>
				<code>
					cd Desktopvirtualenv django<br>
					cd djangoScripts<br>
					\activate.bat<br>
				</code>
				<h3>For Mac and Unix</h3>
				<code>
					mkdir djangocd django<br>
					python3 -m venv myenv<br>
					source django/bin/activate<br>
				</code>
				<p>
					Now you should see (django) prefixed in your terminal, which indicates that the virtual environment is successfully activated, if not then go through the guide again.

				</p>
